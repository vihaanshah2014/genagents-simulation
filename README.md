# Naptha Module Template

This is a base module template for creating agent, agent orchestrator, environment and tool modules. You can check out other examples of agent, orchestrator, environment and tool modules using the CLI commands with the [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk).

## üß© What are Naptha Modules

Naptha Modules are the building blocks of multi-agent applications, which enable them to run across multiple nodes. There are currently five types of Modules:

- **Agent Modules:** Things like Chat Agents, Task-solving Agents, ReAct Agents, etc.
- **Agent Orchestrator Modules:** Things like Organizations of Coding Agents, Social Simulations, etc.
- **Environment Modules:** Things like Group Chats (like WhatsApp for Agents), Information Board (Reddit for Agents), Auctions (eBay for Agents), etc.
- **Tool Modules:** Things like Web Search, Python Code Execution, etc.
- **Persona Modules:** Things like Social Personas generated from exported Twitter data, or synthetically-generated Market Personas

Modules are stored on GitHub, HuggingFace, IPFS, or DockerHub with the URL registered on the Naptha Hub. If you're familiar with Kubeflow Pipelines, Modules are a bit like Components. Modules are based on Poetry Python packages, with some additions like schemas, configs, and an entrypoint. A typical Module has the following structure:

```
- my_module/
  - my_module/
    - __init__.py
    - configs/
      - agent_deployments.json
      - environment_deployments.json
      - llm_configs.json
      - orchestrator_configs.json
    - run.py
    - schemas.py
  - tests/
    - __init__.py
  - pyproject.toml
  - poetry.lock
  - README.md
  - LICENSE
  - .env
  - .gitignore
  - Dockerfile
```

You can run Modules locally, or deploy to a Naptha Node using `naptha run` commands from the [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk). Modules are executed within Poetry virtual environments or Docker containers on Naptha Nodes.

## üèó Creating a new Naptha Module

### üõ† Prerequisites 

#### Install Poetry 

From the official poetry [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer):

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="/home/$(whoami)/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### üîß Making Changes to the Module

Before deploying a new or updated module to a Naptha node, you should iterate on improvements with the module locally. 

### Clone and Install the Module

Clone the repo using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NapthaAI/<module_name>
cd <module_name>
```

Create a copy of the .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If your module calls others modules (e.g. using Agent(), Tool(), or Environment()), you need to set a ```PRIVATE_KEY``` in the .env file (e.g. this can be the same as the ```PRIVATE_KEY``` you use with the Naptha SDK). If using OpenAI, make sure to set the ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` environment variable.

You can install the module using:

```bash
poetry install
```

#### Making Changes to the Code

The main place to make changes to the code is in the ```run.py``` file. This is the default entry point that will be used when the module run is initiated. The run function can instantiate a class (e.g. an agent class) or call a function. 

#### Making Changes to the Configs

You can make changes to the configs in the ```configs``` folder. For example:

**MODEL**: If you would like to use a different model, you can change the ```llm_config['config_name']``` in the ```agent_deployments.json``` file (the ```config_name``` must match the ```config_name``` in the ```llm_configs.json``` file). If using OpenAI, make sure to set the ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` environment variable.

**PERSONA**: If you would like to use a different persona, you can change the ```persona_module['url']``` in the ```agent_deployments.json``` file (the ```url``` must point to a valid Hugging Face dataset).

## üß™ Testing the Module

After making changes to the module, testing usually involves the following steps:

1. Test the module locally without the Naptha Node
2. Test the module on a local Naptha Node (with a local Hub)
3. Test the module on a hosted Naptha Node (with the hosted Naptha Hub)

### üñ•Ô∏è Test the Module Locally without Node

You can run the module using:

```bash
poetry run python <module_name>/run.py
```

This works well too for now 
```bash
poetry run python -m module_template.run
```

```bash
poetry run python -m genagents_simulation.run simulate -p prompt="Consider yourself a typical American citizen." question="Do you support increasing the minimum wage?" type="categorical" options="Yes,No,Undecided" agents=1
```

Now you can iterate on the module and commit your changes. When ready, you can push to your GitHub account or IPFS (or both). Make sure to change the remote origin. Also add a new version number using e.g.:

```bash
git tag v0.1
```

```bash
git push --tags
```

### üåê Test the Module on a Local Node (with a Local Hub)

For this step, you will need to:

1. Run your own Naptha Node and Hub. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node) (still private, please reach out if you'd like access) to run your own Naptha Node and Hub. To run a local Hub, set ```LOCAL_HUB=True``` in the .env file for the NapthaAI/node repository.
2. Install the Naptha SDK using the [instructions here](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk). To use the SDK with your local node and hub, set ```NODE_URL=http://localhost:7001``` and ```HUB_URL=ws://localhost:3001/rpc``` in the .env file for the NapthaAI/naptha-sdk repository.

#### Register the new or updated Module on a local Hub

If creating an agent module, you can register it on the Hub using:

```bash
naptha agents genagents -p "description='based on the GenAgents Paper' url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg' type='package' version='0.1'" 
```
naptha run agent:genagents_simulation -p "{\"func_name\":\"func\", \"func_input_data\":{\"Consider yourself a typical American citizen.\nDo you support increasing the minimum wage?\":[\"Yes\",\"No\",\"Undecided\"]}, \"agent_count\":1}"

If creating an orchestrator module, you can register it on the Hub using:

```bash
naptha orchestrators orchestrator_name -p "description='Orchestrator description' url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg' type='package' version='0.1'" 
```

If creating an environment module, you can register it on the Hub using:

```bash
naptha environments environment_name -p "description='Environment description' url='ipfs://QmNer9SRKmJPv4Ae3vdVYo6eFjPcyJ8uZ2rRSYd3koT6jg' type='package' version='0.1'" 
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder descriptions and URLs with your own. To check that the module is registered correctly, you can run ```naptha agents```, ```naptha orchestrators```, or ```naptha environments```.

#### Running the Module on a local Naptha Node

Once the module is registered on the Hub, you can run it on a local Naptha Node using the Naptha SDK:

```bash
naptha run agent:module_template -p "func_name='func', func_input_data='gm...'" 
```

For troubleshooting, see the Troubleshooting section in NapthaAI/node for checking the logs.
