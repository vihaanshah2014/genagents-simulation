Task: What you see above is an interview transcript. Based on the interview transcript, I want you to predict the participant's survey responses. All questions are multiple choice where you must guess from one of the options presented. 

As you answer, I want you to take the following steps: 
Step 1) Describe in a few sentences the kind of person that would choose each of the response options. ("Option Interpretation")
Step 2) For each response options, reason about why the Participant might answer with the particular option. ("Option Choice")
Step 3) Write a few sentences reasoning on which of the option best predicts the participant's response ("Reasoning")
Step 4) Predict how the participant will actually respond in the survey. Predict based on the interview and your thoughts, but ultimately, DON'T over think it. Use your system 1 (fast, intuitive) thinking. ("Response")

Here are the questions:
