    "content": "Interviewer: To start, I would like to begin with a big question: tell me the story of your life. Start from the beginning -- from your childhood, to education, to family and relationships, and to any major life events you may have had.\n\nJoon: Right. So I was born in Korea. I lived there for the first 12 years or so of my life. And my parents and I moved to Boston. So my parents were pursuing their postdoctoral degree. They're both medical doctors. So we moved to Boston. So we lived there for five years. And then I went to high school in New Hampshire after that, college in Pennsylvania, called Swarthmore College. It's a liberal arts college. And towards the end of my college years, one other co-founder and I started to run a startup. So while we were running that, as we were graduating, we moved to Palo Alto. So we lived by somebody's garage, actually, for about a year. The typical thing that you do if you're into that. The startup itself didn't pan out. But during that year, I got to know this group of researchers and community in the computer science department at Stanford, just by through some luck and just, yeah, through pure luck. And I started to work on some research projects with them. So I spent about a half a year, a little bit more than maybe half a year working with them. And then I went to get my master's in computer science at UIUC, that's Illinois Urbana-Champaign. So I spent two years of my life there. And when I was finishing that up, I moved back to Palo Alto, started my PhD as a computer science PhD student at Stanford. And I've been here since then. So this is my year five of doing that.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that overview! I'd love to learn more about your experiences. Can you tell me what it was like for you adjusting to life in Boston after moving from Korea? What were some of the challenges you faced during that transition?\n\nJoon: It's a good question. Well, moving to a different country and different culture for any child and their parents, it's a heavy lift. But I think likely what was sort of the most interesting was the fact that the entire family, to some extent, was sort of at this point where they were all trying to figure out their career and so forth. My dad actually was already a professor by then and it was sort of his sabbatical years he was spending, so he likely was the most settled amongst us. But certainly for my mom, she was pursuing a postdoctoral degree, so she was transitioning more towards the medical research, the academic research side of things, at least in her discipline. So I think she was really trying to do this sort of a superhuman thing of trying to figure out her new career path, what research areas she wanted to be involved in, while trying to raise a teenager in a new country. So I think that was sort of an interesting period for her and for my parents. And that moment of transition does trickle down to obviously the child as well. So I grew up sort of seeing them trying to figure those kind of things out with a lot of uncertainty. They weren't, I don't think, even sure whether they wanted to stay in the US in sort of the American academic system or sort of head back to Korea, where they sort of could just get a professorship there. So I think they were all trying to figure that out. Maybe as a side effect of that, maybe because of the uncertainty, for some reason, I took this habit of walking around the town quite a bit, often alone. I lived in this small town called Newton. It's a small town in the suburban area of Boston. It's a beautiful place. And I would just walk around and try to sort of get away from things. So that was a transition. \n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging but formative period in your life. You mentioned that you used to walk around a lot to deal with the uncertainties. How did those walks and that time of reflection shape you as a person? Did it have any lasting impact on how you approach new situations or challenges?\n\nJoon: It did. It's a habit that I formed fairly early on and, you know, it's a habit that sort of lasted throughout sort of my teenage years, all the way through high school and parts of college. Obviously, you know, once you're in college, you know, life sort of, you know, takes you in other directions. So you sometimes cannot hang on to your old habits. But certainly when I was a teenager, I'm walking around different places, I think was sort of a big part. It's a good question. I, you know, you think about, you know, some random things, right? I mean, you know, like, what are sort of the main axioms that you want to sort of hold on to in your life? I think sort of the thoughts that I had, I, the way sort of I internalize myself at this point, so I'm now 30, is that I haven't really changed much as a person since I was, let's say, maybe 16 or so. And I think most of the decisions about who I am and who I was going to be, I think I sort of made during those years. I do care a lot about seasons. They just, you know, in season and like nature, right? So Boston and New Hampshire, these areas, you know, there's a lot of snow. So the winter is snowy and brutal, but beautiful in sort of a, you know, very sort of stern way. Spring is bright and you can sort of smell the end of the winter and you can smell the flowers. Summer can be very hot and humid. I sort of grew up being used to humid summers because Korea and I spent some part of my life in Japan as well. And those places have very humid summer. And it was the same for Boston and New Hampshire. Fall, you know, the Boston and New Hampshire falls are beautiful, like one of the most beautiful autumn autumnal sort of places that you can ever find. So, you know, I grew up watching the seasons change and I think it's sort of the nice thing about, you know, I think in part because my parents were also busy, so they didn't really care about what I was doing during the day. Right. Many Asian parents care a lot about what their kids do during the day. My parents didn't really care. So they sort of let me do whatever I wanted to do. That was the case for high school as well. I went to  a boarding school and, you know, in boarding school, sometimes there's, you know, you can be a little bit more free? So I would just walk around the pond or the forest and stuff like that. So there was sort of less supervision in terms of what I could do or what I ought to do. And, you know, I spent most of my time basically sort of in the nature, changing, you know, seeing how the seasons change and all these kind of things. And I don't know what concretely like that, you know, had an impact on other than the fact that I think it had, you know, to me, it feels like that was a very core part of who I was? Something about seeing the nature and seasons change, come and go, and everything repeats, sort of puts you in perspective about like, you know, that, you know, there's the circulatory fractal structure to the life that we live. \n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing all that. It sounds like those walks and the changing seasons had a profound impact on you. Could you tell me more about your time in high school and college\u2014what were some of the formative experiences or relationships that influenced your path towards a career in computer science and research?\n\nJoon: So I was not a computer scientist for most of my childhood and through most of my college years, maybe halfway through college years, I transitioned, but I actually, I was into art and sort of, well, art and music at first. I mean, I was really into music when I was growing up, classical music. I played the violin, sort of the way I describe it as, you know, I wasn't particularly talented in music, but I was really passionate about it. And I spent a lot of hours. So like from middle school to high school, I would practice, you know, three, four hours a day. You know, I sort of saw it as a core part of, you know, who I am, like how I was viewed. Many people sort of, many, you know, friends during those era, not that I had that many friends, but, you know, many friends during that time sort of saw me as, oh, you're the guy who plays the violin, you're the guy who's in the orchestra. So that was sort of a fundamental part of who I was. I wasn't talented again. So, you know, I think there's, I don't think I really had a career in that profession, but I was drawn to those kinds of things. On the side, I would draw a lot. I think, you know, one of the things that I really loved doing was, you know, taking walks and then sort of drawing what I saw, you know, out in nature. I also really like, I don't like, I never really, you know, was sort of the social person or like very like outgoing person. I was very introverted throughout my childhood. And even now I'm very introverted. Although my career does ask me to be a little bit more outgoing nowadays by definition. I was very introverted by nature. So I never really liked talking to people, but I really like observing them. And I made a lot of drawings and paintings of people. And that was always really fun and, you know, a fundamental part of what I really enjoyed during that time. So I did a lot of that. So again, go out, draw, you know, and take photos. I took a lot of photos. And then during that time, one of sort of the high school teacher who was a supervisor in the dorm that I lived, saw one of my drawings and he was the art teacher at our school. And I never took art classes. I didn't know that this was a thing I could do. And he just thought I was drawing for hobby. And then he saw my drawings and he was like, hmm, okay, you're. Well, it sort of started. So, you know, these dorm advisors, they would come once a week. They take rotation every night. And during the nights when he's on rotation, he would come and we would chat and he would bring like these art books and lend them to me. And he was like, hey, you know what you've done here with this art or with this drawing is really interesting in this ways, you know, take a look at this or that, right. So he would do a lot of that, which was really in many ways fortunate for me, obviously. So we spent a lot of time doing that. And then after about half a year to a year, he told me, OK, you're you should join my art class. And I did. And I sort of started sort of a semi-career in art. I mean, you know, I wasn't professional back then, but I was very interested. And I think everyone sort of quickly got the sense that this guy was actually good. You know, he was sort of there is something unusual about the way I sort of went about doing art. So I think they sort of tried to at least get me exposed to more of that environment. And when I went to college, I initially started because of that, perhaps as an art and sociology major. And that continued for most of my time during college. So I was an art major. So I, again, was the guy who spent a lot of time in the studio. So most of times I'd be sort of in this, you know, in this very ragged clothes with a bunch of paint, you know, stains on it and so forth. So I was, you know, a little bit of that character. And so I spent quite a number of hours doing that. And I gradually became fairly, you know, it became clear that, you know, this could actually be a professional career. And interesting thing about my parents was sort of that they were actually OK with that. They actually thought you could actually make or they at least they thought that I could at least make money doing this for whatever reason. And I wouldn't disagree with it. And, you know, I thought we had a shot. So I started to pursue that. But somewhere along the way, I got deeply interested in sort of this more of a technical project. Again, this is where computer science comes in. A technical project where, you know, I had an idea for a startup was sort of all related to self-expression and so forth. So I think there's some obvious thread that we were trying to tie together. And that required technical expertise. So I started to take some computer science courses. So there was a bit of a, you know, undergrad, you know, you're trying to figure out what you want to do. And as I was trying to figure out, oh, am I going to do art? Or is there something else? And I wanted to at least try this out. And I went and Swarthmore was sort of a, you know, this college where they would let you explore different things fairly late on. So they would actually let me take intro to computer science courses and let me double major. So I had to drop sociology, but I got to major in computer science and art at the same time for that time. So I kept on doing that. And when I was graduating, we thought we sort of had a product together. So we decided to just go for it. So it turns out, you know, the work that I ended up doing, so I mean, again, I'm a researcher now, but the work I ended up doing actually is very much like art, right? In the sense that, you know, you write papers, but writing papers is very much like making art pieces and publishing it, right? You get to work on an idea for a long time. It means a lot to you. And it's an expression of, you know, what you experience and so forth. And you get to sort of stamp your name on it and send it out. And that was always sort of a fascinating part of that experience. So that's, I'd say, how that sort of all led to where this is.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Some people tell us that they've reached a crossroads at some points in their life where multiple paths were available, and their choice then made a significant difference in defining who they are. What about you? Was there a moment like that for you, and if so, could you tell me the whole story about that from start to finish?\n\nJoon: It's an interesting question. I enjoyed my time as a researcher and my professional career, I think. I've been very happy with this journey. But what's interesting about the journey that I've taken, or at least the way I perceive my life, was for whatever reason, I never really had that many options. In each sort of moments of my life, in retrospect, I always felt like I got one choice. There wasn't much decision that had to be made where the choice was very obvious. Even all the way back to things like, for instance, where to go to high school and college. I wasn't particularly a good student in any sense of that word for most of my childhood. Maybe I was for some part of it, at least some part that actually mattered. But at the end of the day, I got accepted to one school that actually I would be interested in going. It wasn't sort of this, oh, I have many great options, maybe I can pick and choose. It wasn't quite that. I was like, no, you have one good option, you're going to take that. When I started my professional career, for a while, that actually was the case, too. And then when I was deciding where to be for my PhD career as well, that time, actually, I actually did have options. But my interest has sort of gotten focused enough that I didn't really seriously at some point start to consider other paths, other than, this is what I want to do, and the best place to do it actually here is going to be Stanford, and the people here. So that's how I felt about my journey. I don't know why this ended up being that way. But I always felt like I never really got that many options. And I think it was for the better. And I sort of have accepted that to be a factor of my life where, you know, things are going to happen. Every living moment, I try to do the best work that I can do. And whatever sort of comes next, there will be a path that will open up. And again, I don't expect there to be many paths that I need to, like many great paths that I need to mull over. Like one path will open up for the next stage. And I just need to walk through the door. But just make sure that I walk through it. Sometimes it was a little bit daunting. And I think my, I think there were moments where I sort of had a lot of hesitation, where, you know, the option was clear, but I was sort of afraid to walk through the door for various reasons, right. But sometimes, you know, that can be very daunting. I think I over the years had great set up in my, you know, my parents, especially my mom was sort of my early guide into many of these. But after that, I also had a lot of great mentors who sort of pushed me to make the right choices in these moments. So in that way, I think I was lucky to sort of have had that experience. But yeah, at the end of the day, that's how I see it.\n\n",

    "content": "Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that perspective. It sounds like you've had a clear sense of direction in your life. You mentioned moments of hesitation and fear when a clear option was ahead. Could you tell me about one such specific moment in more detail? What were the stakes, what caused the hesitation, and how did you eventually decide to move forward?\n\nJoon: So you know, when likely the most recent one, you know, was again, I told you that I'm a PhD student, this is my fifth year. And what was interesting was, you know, I wanted to do this research at the intersection of what we call human-computer interaction, AI, and so forth. I always had this view, and this was a little bit coming from my days as a, you know, when I was running startup. But I got the sense that in technology has ebbs and flows, right, where there are periods when technology is sort of in its infancy, but you think something is happening. But technology itself that has been developed during that time isn't ready for the primetime like industry market. During those times, sometimes there's a lot of boom in industry. So when I came into the scene, or when I sort of grew up, this is sort of 2005 to 2015, there was sort of a lot of excitement around, you know, the network, the internet, right, the social network, early sort of versions of social network was just being born. And then pretty soon, there were sort of these gig works that were born as an artifact of these networks. So there was a lot of those applications that were being really successful. But you know, when I was trying to go into the industry was around 2017, and that market was sort of in its, you know, it was very successful, the market was big, but all the known players or what will be the known players were already sort of set in place. So there weren't that many opportunities to crack into that space. But another sort of absent flow that was happening was the research that was sort of in its dormant, like in early stages, when all that movement in industry was going on, especially on AI was actually about to start working, and there was 17 and 18. Like AI didn't really work right before 2014, before ImageNet, and so forth, and before the neural net and all this development. I started to sense, especially, I don't know, the magical part of being in the bear, yeah, was, you know, I sort of got the visceral sense in my body that something was about to change. And, you know, this was the magical part, interestingly, was actually, this wasn't really by talking to anyone, even, or, you know, reading research papers, I was not a researcher back then. So I didn't know anything about this. But just by living in the area, and sort of seeing, you know, people move around, they start to get this sense that, oh, something is about to work. But it wasn't quite there yet, right, it was 2017. So it was before GPT, like all this, like generative AI excitement. So I decided, this might actually be a good time to do research. So I decided, well, so I go do that. So I got very excited by this human-computer interaction and AI area. Because I thought, given my skillset, trying to understand, like, condition the fact that AI might soon work and end its sort of research phase, when would it be the time? What would be the application that AI can really support that's going to be transformative? And given my experience, especially, you know, with the startup and, you know, with my other backgrounds, I realized that that intersection seemed fantastically interesting. For that work, the right place to do that work was, to me, Stanford, right? It was near the industry. And so there was a lot of proximity to many of these exciting research, but also the influence from industry. And at the same time, there were a group of scholars in this space, who ended up becoming my advisors and mentors, who were doing the work that, to me, was sort of the most exciting and inspiring during that era, that, you know, wasn't necessarily AI even sometimes. One of my advisors, Michael Bernstein, you know, he was working on cross-sourcing, Percy Liang. I don't think I yet have been, when I was sort of an undergrad and master's, I haven't yet been sort of introduced to his work yet. But the sense I got was some of the work that they were doing in these different spaces, you know, if something felt right, that a lot of the things that we learned during that era and in these other fields would transfer over as we start thinking about how to apply AI to different applications. So that really got me excited. So, you know, after my master's, the right place to do my PhD, to me, was always internally fairly obvious that I was going to be at Stanford. The scary part is that, well, that means I need to go to Stanford and be amongst all of these amazing colleagues. And what's fun about this is, you know, I got in, right, and I think advisors seem to have had some confidence that I might be a good student. But, you know, that's totally different than now you actually have to join and actually stand next to all these amazing researchers who you've looked up to for many years and that you know they've done great work and you sort of question yourself, like, can I actually do the work? Can I perform at the level where, you know, I would actually make impact, that I wouldn't embarrass myself, that I wouldn't disappoint these sets of really great colleagues. And that scares you. I mean, it certainly scared me. It doesn't stop me, which I think was good. At the same time, I think there were people who ended up giving sort of really good advice. The person who sort of I'm still grateful for, like, there's, I have a mentor named Merrie Morris, and she, Merrie was the first person who told me to just go to Stanford. I don't know why, I don't think she like fully explained her rationale. But she told me, because in part, I was sort of thinking of maybe I can stay at University of Illinois, because you know, I know this environment, it's a great research program. And Merrie told me, well, you've already learned. So it's a good thing to move institutions between programs, right between your master's and then PhD. So go to Stanford. And I listened to Merrie. She was like, actually the only person who said that like straight to my face, like, you know, go to Stanford, or not go to Stanford directly, but like, you know, very strongly implied that it might be a good idea. And I followed her advice. And, you know, and that ended up being a really good decision, in the sense that I got to do the work that I, you know, the type of work that I really wanted to do. And it's been a very exciting journey.\n\n",

I think deeply about it, and when I decide something is a good idea, then it's a very conscious choice. But at the same time, I think the options that were presented to me were presented in a way where any clear thinker would find one right solution, that there wasn't this many options that I can compare against and ponder about. So that's how I saw it.

But my career has really been shaped by many mentors. Early on and even today, my mom did play the role of a professional mentor, in part because she was a researcher. She's a PhD, she's a researcher in a completely different field. She doesn't know what I do, but she sort of understand the cultural context. And she was in fact the first person who recommended to me that I try this out. I think for whatever reason, she thought I might be good at it. She told me, you know, I know you, I know you well enough. I think you'd be good at research. So pursue it and gave me some pointers as to how I might start doing that. I don't think I, you know, I think if I had sort of one superpower, it was having sort of the set of mentors and guides in my life who gave me these advice. And I was very good at discerning what were sort of the advice that I ought to listen to and I follow through with them, right? So I think that was my superpower, which is like I had good set of people giving me mentorship. I appreciated who the good mentors were and what were the good advice. And when I made the promise that, yes, I'll deliver on this or yes, I follow through on this, I did. And that continued to be the case, right? So I mentioned this mentor, Merrie, who over the years had sort of profound impact on sort of how, in my view, my career really shaped up. During my master's, I had this mentor, Carrie Carajalios. She was my master's advisor, another person sort of who had a profound impact in the way sort of I went about building my career. And then Michael Bernstein and Percy Leung, like these advisors, I think sort of continue to play that role and many others. But yeah, so I think these people can always help. Another way of saying it is without them, it's, I don't think you really have a career, you so it's, you need them.\n\n",

It's a small family so I'm the only child. They do, you know, they're a close family. Like I call them every week, you know. And again, they have been a great support. I don't think I, I was a child who, who needed some help in the sense that I am. I, you know, my, I think many of the ideas that I had I think were directionally all right. Right. So the ideas that I got while walking around the woods, certainly I think like that's still who I am. The thoughts I had in my like late middle school and high school era, like that is who I am even today. So I think they're true or at least have served me well. But the way you sort of marry that with reality, sometimes, you know, you need a little bit more finesse. My, my idea of a good life was to be self-sufficient. And then like I still have this book, Walden by Henry Thoreau. You know, like when I was growing up in Boston, I usually, every weekend I had my mom drive up to, drive me up to Walden Pond. You know, that's where, of course, Henry Thoreau wrote the book. And we would walk around. It's, you know, by, so we conquered where the Walden Pond is located. Really wasn't that far from where we lived. It's a beautiful town. I still love it. And, you know, one of the places where I would love to visit if I had the time. And, you know, my, my idea of a good life actually was be like that. Right. You know, sort of be self-sufficient to some extent, or maybe run a small shop, but, you know, in a small town, I actually still think that's actually a good life. And honestly, like, I think there's actually a fairly good chance that I might just do that at some point in my career. And, you know, when I feel like I might work here, it's mostly done. And I think I'd be very happy doing that even now. But, you know, there are certain things that you cannot explore unless you sort of, you know, venture out and actually do the rigorous work of making things happen as well. And I didn't really have any sense of that. I was, in some kids, I think, actually do have a sense of that, right? They know that, oh, you know, you do your sort of place in this context of society and so forth. So, you know, sometimes that actually comes more naturally to some people, it did not come naturally to me. So I need a lot of help there. So yeah. So that's what I would say. So there. So my again, my parents are important to me. And, yeah, in terms of partner and children, I do not have any kids, or I'm not married.\n\n",

Sometimes when it's sort of a deadline season, you're mostly, hopefully, in the writing mode. Other times you're brainstorming, you're meeting with people to get ideas, you're running experiments, building systems. So towards the end of, towards the latter year now of my PhD career, I sort of see things merge, right? So one day I need to be building a system, the next day I need to go back to writing for a different project or a different duty that I might have. There's also interesting amount of outreach, whether it's interview with other people or the media, to meeting people, to talk about my own research, and then there's more professional connection that you sort of need to build up over the years. It's certainly enjoyable. It's fun. I've had a lot of fun doing it, but it's very dynamic. So there's no sort of typical week anymore, but I'm usually in the lab seven days a week, I think, for most sort of hours. So I'm usually in the lab. I'm a night owl, so I come in around 11 a.m. or 12. I leave around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. \n\n",

And I think one of the reasons why I feel like this quarter actually has been a little bit busier than usual, where I at least try to take one evening off, so I usually have sort of this big sort of high-stake meeting, like, it's advisor meeting for PhD students, it's a project meeting, mine's on Thursday, 2 p.m., and that's been the time. So for my PhD career, I, in the past, like, when I was younger, in, like, first and second year, I actually took the weekends, or maybe, like, Friday off, or something like that, I took a day or so off, but in the recent years, I tried at least to take Thursday evening off after the advisor meeting, I'm like, okay, at least for that day, I'm done now that I'm done with this really big-stake, like, meeting. I lost that, and that still was big, so I usually need to get back to some other kind of duty after that meeting, and that feels really new to me, and I sort of tried to figure out why that's the case. I think a big part of this, I'm teaching this quarter, as I mentioned, so I am developing this new course on AI agents and simulations. We never offered it, but we are offering it as a core CS and AI curriculum at Stanford, and it's sort of, you know, it's a decently-sized class, never been taught, the course material is sort of, I'm making as I go. It's been really fulfilling and gratifying, but at the same time, the workload is non-trivial, so adding that to my existing schedule certainly, I think, did a number on my calendar, so that's been sort of the recent change that happened.\n\n",

And some of them were very vocal about things, too. And I think there's sort of a lot of uncertainty as to whether this is the right direction, whether this is rigorous enough. So there was a lot of challenge with that. And it does cause a lot of sort of emotional struggle as well as sort of a mental and intellectual struggle. But it's part of the job.

Managing people in that way, in that context, I think you sort of need to have the balance between the care but also sort of the discipline to push the project through.

What kind of things are you drawn by? What do you find beautiful? So you pursue that to the best of your ability, and looking back, you hope that the path you took will have had a meaning, but it's a little bit hard to tell what kind of meaning those paths will have.

Maybe you want it to be different in some ways. What do you hope for?\n\nJoon: You know, the work I do on AI agents and, you know, and human-computer interaction, it means a lot to me. What I hope is in the years to come, this field grows into a field that actually has a certain impact, that is positive and impactful to people's lives. Especially the work that we're sort of leading has to do with this idea of simulations, right? Simulating human lives and societies so that we can better test out policies and social scientific theories. And my hunch is that if you can do that really well, there's going to be a huge opportunity to empower our society in the way we sort of navigate the wicked challenges and so forth. That really excites me. Doing a sort of a, you know, doing our work so that we can lay the foundation in that line of work and being a, you know, meaningful and fruitful steward of the field, that matters a lot to me. I do care a lot about sort of the artistic passion in the sense that, I mean, this is all a creative process. So I do think many of the things, when I look back, a lot of, I look back to the work that I've done as sort of, you know, and to get the sense of whether, you know, the path I took was a fruitful one. And I think it's so long as it's true to me and the way I sort of decided to live. I think that's what matters. So that's what I hope. I do one day, you know, like to, you know, live somewhere quieter, maybe in the mountains or, you know, somewhere like that. And, you know, maybe have a small, you know, cafe or something. I joke about that, but I think there's some elements of truth in that. I really do sort of admire slightly more idyllic lifestyle too. So maybe someday, maybe I can paint and stuff like that, if ever comes to that. Thank you.\n\n",
