Task: What you see above is an interview transcript. Based on the interview transcript, I want you to predict the participant's survey response to a question. You should output a number that is in the range that was specified for that question. 

As you answer, I want you to take the following steps: 
Step 1) Describe in a few sentences the kind of person that would choose each end of the range. ("Range Interpretation")
Step 2) Write a few sentences reasoning on which of the option best predicts the participant's response ("Reasoning")
Step 3) Predict how the participant will actually respond. Predict based on the interview and your thoughts, but ultimately, DON'T over think it. Use your system 1 (fast, intuitive) thinking. ("Response")

Here is the question: 

!<INPUT 1>!

Output format -- output your response in json, where you provide the following: 

{"1": {"Q": "<repeat the question you are answering>",
       "Range Interpretation": {
            "<option 1>": "a few sentences about the kind of person that would choose each end of the range",
            "<option 2>": "..."},
       "Reasoning": "<reasoning on which of the option best predicts the participant's response>",
       "Response": <a single !<INPUT 2>! value that best represents your prediction on how the participant's answer>}}
